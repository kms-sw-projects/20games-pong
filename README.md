**Pong**
========
This is an implementation of Pong in the Godot games engine.

I've made this as part of the 20 games challenge that you can read more about here: https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/.

Getting it to run
-----------------
Simply download the folder and import the project into godot.

The game
----------
Inside the godot editor, the game can be run in debug mode. If "one Player" is selected, the player controls the left paddle with the keys *w* (up) and *s* (down). 
The other paddle is controlled by a simple AI script.

Multiplayer
-------------
If "two players" is selected in the main menu then the second player controls the right paddle with the up and down arrow keys.
